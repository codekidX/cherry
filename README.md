> ### Simple. Clean. Declarative.

Rubik framework aims to provide a declarative and reusable abstaction over net/http. Using rubik
as your framework will make sure that you do not write any code more than once and also be
efficient in constructing a block-based application instead of extensions. The framework is
designed to be extremely extensible, meaning, any Go module can be attached to this server
without the need of explicit dependency injection.

### Core Goals

- [x] Make Rubik fun to work with!
- [ ] Provide a great tooling for Rubik
- [ ] Make client-server development in easier Go
- [ ] Easier inter-server communication
- [ ] On-demand client server communication
