Ink aims to ease and speedup client-side development with Go. The server side development was too quick, simple and easy and when I tried to create a cli for my project [cloak](https://github.com/codekidX/cloak) it was too time consuming and repetitve. I wanted something that would speed up my client-side development with Go and here I would like to introduce to you **Ink** a HTTP client that let's me write Go API calls in breeze.
