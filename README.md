Rubik framework aims to provide a declarative and reusable abstaction over net/http. Using rubik
as your framework will make sure that you do not write any code more than once and also be
efficient in constructing a block-based application instead of extensions. The framework is
designed to be extremely extensible, meaning, any Go module can be attached to this server
without the need of explicit dependency injection.
